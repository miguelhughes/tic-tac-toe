### "Time traveling" Tic Tac Toe game

features:

- Fully functional tic tac toe game.
- There's a move history list on the right, that allows sorting in either ascending or descending order.
- (and here's the time traveling part): the history on the right is clickable, allowing to navigate through all the states that the game has been in. The game is still playable after "time-traveling", allowing to try out new solutions/alternatives.
- When someone wins the three squares that caused the win are hightlighted, with a nice CSS background animation.
- When no one wins, a message stating that the result is a draw is displayed.

This project was built as part of the ["Intro to React" tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Most of the focus was on the js code, with minimal attention to CSS, UI or general appeal. This should be improved in the following versions (centered in the ui, proper spacing/padding to the history on the right, bigger buttons)
