features: 
- Fully functional tic tac toe game, x always starts.
- There's a move history list on the right, that allows sorting in either ascending or descending order.
- (and here's the time traveling part): the history on the right is clickable, allowing to navigate through all the states that the game has been in.
- When someone wins the three squares that caused the win are hightlighted, with a nice css background animation.
- When no one wins, a message stating that the result is a draw is displayed.
